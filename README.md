# Overview
Welcome to my Analysis of the data job market, focusing on data analysts roles. This project was made out of a desire to navigate and understand the job market more effectively. It delves into the top-paying and in-demand skills to find the most optimal oppotunities for data analysts.

> ðŸ“Š This dashboard was built as part of a YouTube tutorial by [Luke Barousse].  
> Data used in this project was provided in the original course and is used here for learning purposes.

# The Questions
Below are questions I wanna answer in my project:
- What are the most in-demand skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?
- How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
- how well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
- What are the most optimal skills for Data Analysts to learn?

# Tools I Used
For my deep dive into the data analysts job market, i used those powerful toold:
- **Python**: The background of my analysts, allwoing me to explore and analyze the data and find critical insights, I also used the following python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** Used to analyze data.
    - **Matplotlib Library:** Used to visualize data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** Helped me create more advanced visuals.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** The tool I used to run my python code which let me easily include my notes and analysis
- **VS Code** An Environment to execute my code.
- **Git & GitHub** Essential for version control and shaing my python code and analysis.

# The Analysis
Each Jupyter Notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market.

### 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular Data Jobs?
to find the most demanded skills for the top 3 popular data roles, i first filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and then i got the top 5 skills for each one of the top 3 roles, this query highlights the most popular job titles in data roles with thier associated top skills, showing which skills to pay attention to depending on the role i'm prefering more

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(top_3_jobs), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(top_3_jobs):
    csv_plot = csv_skills_perc[csv_skills_perc['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(
        data=csv_plot,
        x='skills_percentage',
        y='job_skills',
        ax=ax[i],
